<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a motivated and ambitious professional with a strong focus on technology, problem-solving, and continuous growth. After starting my career in real estate, I shifted my path toward the digital world, where I’m now pursuing computer science and technical skills that will allow me to thrive in remote and global opportunities. I’m currently studying computer science fundamentals through Harvard’s CS50 program while building hands-on experience with coding, digital marketing, and online business tools. My long-term goal is to establish a high-level career in tech that combines creativity, technical expertise, and adaptability.</p>

<p>Outside of work and study, I’m passionate about art, storytelling, and gaming. I enjoy creating and analyzing strategies in games like Total War and League of Legends, which sharpen my ability to think critically and plan effectively—skills I also apply to real-world challenges. Creativity has always been a part of my identity, from exploring design ideas to immersing myself in fantasy and world-building, and I aim to bring that same creative perspective into everything I do professionally.</p>

<p>Looking forward, I’m dedicated to building a future where I can combine technical knowledge, problem-solving, and creativity into a career that is both impactful and rewarding. My vision is not only to succeed personally but also to contribute value to projects, teams, and businesses I become a part of. I’m always open to collaboration, new ideas, and opportunities that push me to grow further—because for me, learning and creating never truly stop.</p>
